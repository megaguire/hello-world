# hello-world
Greg's very first repository

Hello, everyone! My name is Greg Maguire. I'm fascinated by tornados, roller coasters, and sharks -- in that order. I recently learned the difference between a dash and an em-dash (wow!) and I'm also very opinionated about using exclamation marks.

This has been a lovely first commit. Thoroughly enjoyable.
